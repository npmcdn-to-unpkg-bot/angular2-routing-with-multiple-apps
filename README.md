## Routing with multiple apps
This is an experiment with angular2 and component router where multiple apps on same page use routing.

It's missing some shims/polyfills and does not work currently with IE

## Running 

Just use browser-sync

```
npm install -g browser-sync
browser-sync start -server
```
And then browser to localhost:3000
